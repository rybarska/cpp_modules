OVERVIEW

This repository contains solutions to the C++ modules 00 to 03 from the 42 school curriculum.
These modules are designed to teach and reinforce the fundamentals of object-oriented programming,
class design, and inheritance. Each module focuses on specific language features, progressively
increasing in complexity.


MODULE DESCRIPTION

static, const, and some other basics

C++ Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

C++ Module 02
