OVERVIEW
This repository contains solutions to the C++ modules 00 to 03 from the 42 school curriculum.
These modules are designed to teach and reinforce fundamental C++ concepts,
from basic syntax to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming,
fixed-point arithmetic, and the Orthodox Canonical Form.
Each module focuses on specific language features, progressively increasing in complexity.


MODULE DESCRIPTION

Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists,
static, const, and some other basics

C++ Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

C++ Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form

C++ Module 03
Multiple inheritance (the diamond-shaped inheritance pattern), polymorphism,
method overriding, scope resolution, constructor chaining
